Rev C

Three-axis joystick mecanum control.

Let y, x, and z be the rev/fwd, strafe left/right, and spin CCW/CW axes, respectively, which each vary from -1 to +1.


So:

y= -1 corresponds to full speed reverse, y= +1 corresponds to full speed forward,

x= -1 corresponds to full speed strafe left, x= +1 corresponds to full speed strafe right,

z= -1 corresponds to full speed spin CCW, z= +1 corresponds to full speed spin CW


When the joystick is pushed forward, its Y output should be positive. When the joystick is pushed to the right, its X output should be positive.  When the joystick is twisted clockwise, its Z output should be positive.  If not, add code to invert the sign if necessary.


Let w1, w2, w3, and w4 be the commands to send to each of the 4 wheels, where w1 is front left, w2 is front right, w3 is rear left, w4 is rear right, as viewed from the top.


Let Kf, Ks, and Kt be tuning parameters (0 to +1) for the fwd/rev, strafe, and spin joystick sensitivities, respectively.


set the four wheel speed commands as follows:

w1 = Kf*y + Ks*x + Kt*z

w2 = Kf*y - Ks*x - Kt*z

w3 = Kf*y - Ks*x + Kt*z

w4 = Kf*y + Ks*x - Kt*z


You're almost done. All that remains is to normalize the above commands so that their range is -1 to +1. Proceed as follows:

- look at the magnitude (absolute value) of each of the four commands, and select the MAXIMUM. for sake of discussion, call this maximum value Wmax

- if Wmax is less than or equal to 1, no scaling is required. Just use the four w commands as-is

- if Wmax is greater than 1, then divide EACH of the four w values by Wmax.

That's all there is to it. Send each w command to the corresponding wheel (where -1 means 100% reverse, and +1 means 100% forward).


Set Kf, Ks, and Kt to +1 initially, then adjust each one down (but not less than zero) individually as required to obtain the desired joystick sensitivity to the three motions.


One note of caution: make sure the polarity of the motors on each side of the bot is wired correctly (each wheel must be spinning in the "forward" direction when it gets a "+" command).  An easy way to observe this is to elevate the bot and push the joystick forward; all four wheels should be spinning forward.
