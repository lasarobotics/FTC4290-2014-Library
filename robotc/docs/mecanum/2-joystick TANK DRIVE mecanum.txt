Here's a way to program TANK DRIVE on a mecanum bot so that you can tune the joystick sensitivity to all three motions (fwd/rev, turn, stafe) independently:

Let Kf, Kt, and Ks be the tuning parameters (0 to +1) for the forward/reverse, turn, and strafe motions, respectively.

Let X1 and Y1 represent the joystick outputs for the driver's left-hand joystick (-1 to +1);

Let Y2 represent the joystick outputs for the driver's right-hand joystick (-1 to +1).  

When each joystick is pushed forward, its Y output should be positive. When the joystick is pushed to the right, its X output should be positive. If not, add code to invert the sign if necessary.

Let W1, W2, W3, and W4 be the front left, front right, rear left, and rear right wheels, respectively. ("left" and "right" in this context means "port" and "starboard", respectively)



Calculate the following:

Yf = (Y1 + Y2)/2

Yt = (Y1 - Y2)/2


Now calculate the four wheel speed commands:

W1 = Kf*Yf + Kt*Yt + Ks*X1

W2 = Kf*Yf - Kt*Yt - Ks*X1

W3 = Kf*Yf + Kt*Yt - Ks*X1

W4 = Kf*Yf - Kt*Yt + Ks*X1



Now normalize the wheel speed commands:

Let Wmax be the maximum absolute value of the four wheel speed commands. If Wmax is greater than 1, then divide each of the four wheel speed commands by Wmax.


Finally, send each of the four normalized wheel speed commands to the respective wheels (-1 means 100% reverse, +1 means 100% forward).

The Y1 and Y2 axes act like tank drive.  The X1 axis commands strafe left and right.  The X2 axis is not used.

Tune Kf, Kt, and Ks (from 0 to +1) to get the desired joystick sensitivity to each of the three motions.
