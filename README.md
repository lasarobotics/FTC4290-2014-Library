LASA FTC Development Library
======

##Welcome
Welcome to the Liberal Arts and Science Team Purple Haze`s shared FTC library.

###Philosophy
- To **create** universally applicable methods for future coders to use
- To **design** a variety of methods to simplify and strategize the coding process
- To **code**  with two languages, creating identical LabVIEW and RobotC subprograms

###Structure
- One branch
- Two folders: **labview** and **robotc**
- Three subfolders: **assets** (including images), **docs** (including whitepapers), and **src** (where the code goes)
- Documentation and whitepapers placed in the **docs** folder in either the main directory (for general whitepapers) or its appropriate programming language
- Releases named after famous inventors (e.g. Altshuller, Bell, etc.) after major stable code changes

###Contributing
- **Write code**: place in src directory under appropriate language
- **Write docs**: whitepapers or method commentary appreciated! (place in docs directory under appropriate language)
